# ANTLR4 Parser

This directory contains a Go parser generated by ANLTR4, using [antlr4ts](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4ts).

The ANTLR4 grammar files are from [here](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/golang).

The grammar files were used to generate the parsers, which are in the `out/` folder.

## How to use

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

This compiles the TypeScript files to JavaScript files which are in the `build/` folder (gitignored).
